# PySpark Data Cleaning Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates data cleaning and reporting using PySpark.
Raw sales CSV data is cleaned, transformed, and converted into meaningful business reports.

## Tools Used
- Python
- PySpark
- Spark SQL
- Jupyter Notebook

## Problems in Raw Data
- Extra spaces in text columns
- Null and invalid values in sales amount
- Incorrect date formats
- Duplicate records
- Data not suitable for reporting

Such data cannot be directly used for business analysis.

## What I Did
- Cleaned and trimmed string columns

- Generated business reports

## Reports Generated
- Total sales per day
- Top selling products
